      "featureTitle": "Replace the existing Internet Identity login page (frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx) with a professional OTP-based login UI. The page must have two steps: Step 1 — an email input field with a 'Send OTP' button; Step 2 — a 6-digit OTP input (individual digit boxes or a single input) with a 'Verify OTP' countdown timer (10 minutes), a 'Resend OTP' link, and a 'Verify' button. Display the generated OTP inline (simulated delivery) in a highlighted info banner since real email delivery is not available. On successful verification, store the session (email + verified status) and redirect to the dashboard or Profile Setup if the profile is incomplete. Apply the existing emerald green and dark teal brand theme consistently.",
