Please log out and log in again.' error banner that appears when the user submits the profile setup form with a valid Internet Identity session. The modal must not show any authentication error to a user who is actively authenticated. On form submission, if the actor is null or unavailable, silently wait for the actor to be ready (up to a reasonable timeout) before invoking saveCallerUserProfile. If the call still fails, surface a generic retry message — never the 'Authentication failed' or 'Log out and try again' text — unless the identity is genuinely expired.",

Before calling saveCallerUserProfile, confirm the actor is non-null and the identity is authenticated. If the actor is unavailable, throw an error clearly labeled 'actor_not_ready' (not 'session_expired') so ProfileSetupModal.tsx can distinguish and handle it without showing false authentication failure messages.",
