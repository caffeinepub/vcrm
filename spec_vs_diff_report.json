  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements: REQ-1 (Super Admin hardcoded in backend with bypass logic), REQ-2 (admin query/mutation functions for listing/approving/rejecting users), REQ-3 (auth guard fix in Layout.tsx), and REQ-4 (AdminPage.tsx with tabs, approve/reject actions, and sidebar link). The implementation appears largely complete, though one minor acceptance criterion regarding 'registration date' display in the Admin Panel is not clearly evidenced.",

      "reason": "The AdminPage.tsx UserRow component displays user name, email/principal, and phone, but there is no evidence of a registration date field being shown. The UserApprovalInfo type may carry a timestamp but it is not rendered in the visible truncated diff.",
